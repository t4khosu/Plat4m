# Plat4m

This is one of the first and biggest games (unfinished) I have worked on so far. The development took a few months.
The reason for this kind of project was learning how OOP and game programming works.

## Setup
* java >= 11
* Requirements: None (just run the main and enjoy the game)

## Warnings
Since this game is really old and I am from Germany, the in-game language is German. Also the game is not that polished, so keep your expectations down.
Saving does not work and there are certainly some bugs I have not fixxed. Back than I didn't write tests, so ... I am scared to touch this code without spending hours and hours
of refactoring.

## Learnings
I love game programming, but looking back I see some major flaws.
1. Color. FYI the blue person is the character you can control. Also the pixel sizes vary which is a bit strange.
2. Controls. The character moves way too fast and jump height can not be controlled.
3. Size. For a single person to finish something like this while studying full time is kind of impossible.
4. Libraries. I am really happy I didn't use any. This way I learned so many things. However, it is really hard to maintain this project any longer and some predefined functions like in unity definitely would have helped me.
